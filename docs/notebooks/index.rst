Feature Based Scheduler Jupyter Notebooks
=========================================
It is possible to run the feature based scheduler in jupyter notebooks. This
is useful for examining the basis functions, and doing quick evaluations of
how a given configuration is performing. These notebooks can also be found
the ``sims_featureScheduler`` repository `here <https://github.com/lsst/sims_featureScheduler/tree/master/examples>`_.
